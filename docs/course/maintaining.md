# Maintaining this guide

## Editing and publishing

Edit Markdown in `docs/`, run `npm ci` if needed, then `npm run check` and `npm run docs:build`. Push to `main`; GitHub Actions builds and publishes GitHub Pages. Pull requests run the same content/build checks without deployment.

## Confirm a Demo Day request

1. Review the issue's section, team size, slot preference, links, and contribution plan.
2. Check the schedule data and other pending requests for conflicts. A request does not reserve a slot automatically.
3. Edit `data/demo-schedule.json`. Set the slot's `assignment` to an object such as `{"issue": 12, "team": "Example project"}`. Use an actual signup issue; the example number is not a booking.
4. For a trio use the reserved 12-minute slot. Other changes to slot sizes/times require checking the day's ending time and notifying affected teams.
5. Run `npm run schedule:sync`, `npm run check`, and `npm run docs:build`. Commit both data and generated schedule pages.
6. Comment on the signup issue with the confirmed section/date/time/slot, apply `confirmed`, and remove `signup-request` if appropriate. Publish the change. Closing an issue alone does not cancel a slot; update the data too.

Do not publish rosters or private student records. Team handles and public-facing project titles are sufficient. Resolve private circumstances through Canvas.

## Keep career references useful

For each internship retain the employer URL, research date, location, eligibility, deadline wording, and evidence status. Mark closed or unverified roles as examples. Do not convert an annualized salary into an internship payout. No automated deadline monitoring is configured.

## Course changes

Update schedule/source notes when Canvas or registrar details change. Keep graded deadlines in Canvas and distinguish planning targets from due dates. Preserve prior assignment criteria for already-submitted work.
